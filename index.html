                <h1>My name is Paul</h1>
            </div>
            <div class = mobweltxt txtwelcard2>
                <p><b>I'm a father of two amazing boys</b> and a full time spare parts assistant working at the engineering stores of a global company. My hobbies are anything IT or music related, I enjoy learning, gaming, playing chess and am a multi instrumentalist who produces their own original music. I live in South Wales where I have spent the majority of my life, and though I do love to travel, deep down I would rather be home. I live near a great beach with the valleys and rivers a 10 min drive away. I love to spend time with my children, whether it's gaming with them, teaching them or travelling together, as cliche as it may sound, they really are my world. If my children are not with me I love nothing more than to spend time on the sofa, either on the PS5 or primarily the PC. Whether it's audio production, video production, or some random tutorials, I would rather learn something new than waste time watching TV. That's not to say I don't watch any TV, though it's usually a series on Netflix or Prime that take's forever to watch because I fall to sleep in 5 minutes. My current favourites are Rick and Morty, The Boys and One Punch Man. </p>

            <div class = mobweltxt txtwelcard3>
                <p><b>At least that's what I tell myself!</b> I remember writing my first ever program, I must have been around 10 years old as I was visiting the library of the local comprehensive school which I soon later attended. I found an interesting book called "Monster Wrestling", it was for a language called "BASIC", I was intrigued. I took the book to my grandmothers house where I spent the evening. I booted up my BBC Acorn Electron and started hammering out the lines of code from the book line by line, bit by bit. It took me hours, but I finished it. I ran the code. "Please insert a tape and press enter". What? I was 10 years old, I didnt have a tape, and my grandmother probably wouldnt have known what to do with one even if she had one. I was absolutley gutted and never got to play Monster Wrestling, I did however gain a keen interest in coding which has remained with me throughout life. Whilst I am far from an expert in any language, I have on and off worked with HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, PHP, Query Language and Javascript amongst others. I spend a lot of time each and every day at a PC.</p>
