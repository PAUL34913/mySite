                <p><b>Welcome to firedocs,</b> a site dedicated to my study of full stack web development. Within these pages you will find resources that will enhance and grow as I progress through the course and learn new technologies. Once the main layout is complete, examples from the course will be archived once completed so that others may benefit and progress their own skills within the full stack environment. I have tinkered with web design on and off over the last 25 years and in 2021 decided to study for a higher national diploma with Code Institute. Unfortunately it was during the covid period, where I had lost my full time job and was bouncing around various jobs with agencies. Due to work demands with shifts in particular, mixed with family commitments, I decided to withdraw from the course. With my life now settled and more constant study time available, I have decided to resume my studies for my own personal interest. I hope you enjoy the site, if you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to get in touch.</p>

                <h1>My name is Paul</h1>
            </div>
            <div class = mobweltxt txtwelcard2>
                <p><b>I'm a father of two amazing boys</b> and a full time spare parts assistant working at the engineering stores of a global company. My hobbies are anything IT or music related, I enjoy learning, gaming, playing chess and am a multi instrumentalist who produces their own original music. I live in South Wales where I have spent the entirety of my life, as much as I love to travel, I also love to come home. I live near a great beach with the valleys and rivers a 10 min drive away. I love to spend time with my children, whether it's gaming with them, teaching them or travelling together, as cliche as it may sound, they really are my world. If my children are not with me I love nothing more than to spend time on the sofa, either on the pS5 or primarily the PC. I would rather learn something new than waste time watching TV. That's not to say I don't watch any TV, though it's usually a series on Netflix or Prime in bed that take's forver to watch because I fall to sleep in 5 minutes. Current faves are Rick and Morty, The Boys and One Punch Man.</p>

            <div class = mobweltxt txtwelcard3>
                <p><b>At least that's what I tell myself!</b> I remember writing my first ever program, I must have been around 10 years old as I was visiting the library of the local comprehensive school which I soon later attended. I found an interesting book called "Monster Wrestling", it was for a language called "BASIC", I was intrigued. I took the book to my nans where I spent the evening and booted up my BBC Acorn Electron and started hammering out out the lines of code from the book. It took me hours, but I finished it. I ran the code. Please insert a tape and press enter. What? I was 10 years old, I didnt have a tape. I was absolutley gutted and never got to play Monster Wrestling, I did however gain a keen interest in coding which has remained with me throughout life. Whilst I am far from an expert in any language, I have on and off worked with HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, PHP, Query Language and Javascript amongst others. I use Excel daily at work amongst other software and spend a lot of time each and every day at a PC. </p>
